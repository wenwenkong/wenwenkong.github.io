Climate Scientist, Data Scientist

I am currently exploring the nexus between energy transition and technology. 

My academic interests centers on dynamics and variability of weather and climate. Keywords of my past work include climate modeling, paleoclimate, monsoon, land-atmosphere interaction, and temperature extremes. 

I earned my Ph.D. in climate dynamics from University of California, Berkeley. My dissertation, advised by [Professor John Chiang](https://pages.github.berkeley.edu/jch-chiang/webpage/), seeks to understand and predict the seasonal transition of summer monsoonal precipitation in East Asia. I received my postoctoral training at University of California, Los Angeles. During my postdoc, I collaborated with [Professor Karen McKinnon](https://karenamckinnon.github.io/) (UCLA) and [Dr. Isla Simpson](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/islas) (NCAR) to understand roles of land surface conditions and large-scale atmospheric processes in affecting moments (variance, skewness, and kurtosis) of near-surface air temperature over land.

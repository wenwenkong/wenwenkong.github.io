Statistics and Climate Journal Club at UCLA was founded by [Sam Baugh](https://samjbaugh.github.io) and myself in October 2020, thanks to the suggestion and help from [Professor Karen McKinnon](https://karenamckinnon.github.io/).

Since then, we have been running the journal club at a bi-weekly cadence and hosted the discussion primarily on the virtual sphere due to the COVID. These discussions are made possible by contributions and participations of many colleagues at UCLA, especially those who have served as discussion leads. We also hosted a few seminar talks, delivered by speakers who generously shared their research with us remotely.
